CC2538 Development Board
========================

This is the hardware design of a development board for the [CC2538 chip of Texas Instruments](http://www.ti.com/product/cc2538).

You can find more info about the design and hardware decisions [in this blog post](http://jelmertiete.com/2014/05/07/cc2538-development-board/)

The pcb antenna used in this design has its own repository: https://github.com/JelmerT/Eagle-2.4gHz-folded-dipole-pcb-antenna

I also wrote a handy serial bootloader for this dev-board and other CC2538 (and CC26XX and 31XX) hardware, which you can find here: https://github.com/JelmerT/cc2538-bsl

If you improve this design in any way, consider submitting a pull request or contact me. I'd appreciate it if you let me know if you use this design in a real deployment. I'd like to add your project to this page.
